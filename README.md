# Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The increasing Demand for bike riders which led to the recent development of the bikeshare systems used in the United states have now become very popular in the US cities. This system work by allowing people to rent a bicycle for a specified period of time at an agreed price. These users are required to return the bikes after the agreed peirods are reached.

With the large number of users and rental outlet, the need to pull data to keep record of bikes shared, as well as their pick up and drop off point has become very imperative. Thankfully, inforamtion technology such as python and the likes can be used to pull these big data and analyse them to best understand and effectively managed the bikeshare systems.

Now, this project seeks to examine the data given by Motivate and provide significant patterns of the bikeshare system. The software used in this project are; Git bash, Python 3 and an Atom text editor
